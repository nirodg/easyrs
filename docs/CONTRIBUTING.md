# Contribuiting

Thank you for considering contributing! There are many ways you can help.

# Branches

I've decided to stick to **Gitflow's workflow**, so please consider to read about it before to start.

1. [Gitflow Workflow](https://de.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow) by [Atlassian.com](Atlassian.com)
2. [A successful Git branching model](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)

# Projects

For each version a new project will be created in order to have the issues/features grouped so it will be cleaner and easier to find the ticket.

# Issues

File an issue if you think you've found a bug. Be sure to describe

1. How can it be reproduced?
2. What did you expect?
3. What actually occurred?
4. version, platform, etc. if possibly relevant.

# Commit

1. When commiting refactored code \(_it won't fix the issue_\) regarding an issue please be sure to add the Tiket ID as a prefix. Example: `git commit -m "#1 Improved README.md"` 
2. When commiting fixes, please follow as is mentioned in [Closing issues via commit messages](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) :  Example: `git commit -m "Fixes #1 - Added README.md "` 

# Formating

* `Java > Code Style > Formating` and import [**eclipse-java-google-style.xml**](https://github.com/google/styleguide/blob/gh-pages/eclipse-java-google-style.xml)** . **It can be found also under `docs/`
